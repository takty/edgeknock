Edgeknock is a utility for Windows that allows you to launch specific applications by knocking on the edge of the screen. Users can launch any application by knocking at a specific position on the screen.


## Features

- Launch any application by knocking on the edge of the screen
- Launch applications with user-defined shortcut keys
- Launch applications by aligning the pointer to the corner of the screen
- Customize settings via an INI file


## Installation & Un-installation

To install Edgeknock, decompress the archive file and place all decompressed files in a specific folder.
This application does not write anything to the registry.
Therefore, to uninstall it, simply remove all files.


## How to Upgrade

Just overwrite the executable file 'Edgeknock.exe'.
However, sometimes you need to transfer old settings into the new INI file.


## Usage

When you start this application, you will see 'Edgeknock' in a small window, which disappears soon.
Try knocking on the top third of the left edge of the screen twice.
If you can launch 'Calc', you did it.
Also, as a sample, you can launch 'Calc' by moving the cursor to the bottom-left corner of the screen, or by typing Ctrl + Shift + C.

To customize the sensitivity of the knocking and the applications that are launched, you need to edit the INI file.
This application monitors the editing of the INI file, and it automatically reflects the change after saving the INI file.
To stop this application, execute 'Edgeknock.exe' again.
